PROGRAM ALGORITHM FOR LOAN

PAWNING MODULE REVISION
NEW LOAN
1. Input Pawn Information
2. If INT_HASH has no value then hash TBLINT
3. If INT_HASH didn't exist at TBLINT_HISTORY, COPY TBLINT to TBLINT_HISTORY with HASH as CHECKSUM
4. Use TBLINT as basis of computation
5. Save the pawn info with the hashvalue

RENEWAL
1. Load PT
2. if INT_HASH has no value then hash TBLINT
3. Compare INT_HASH and the Pawn INT Hash
4. If the same, use TBLINT as basis, if not then filter TBLINT_HISTORY for the hash, and use it as basis.
5. If not found, ERROR and call for technical asssistance, END.
6. Compute the INT base where Pawn INT hash matches
7. Save the Pawn Info with the hash value of the previous Pawn INT

REDEEM
1. Load PT
2. if INT_HASH has no value then hash TBLINT
3. Compare INT_HASH and the Pawn INT Hash
4. If the same, use TBLINT as basis, if not then filter TBLINT_HISTORY for the hash, and use it as basis.
5. If not found, ERROR and call for technical asssistance, END.
6. Compute the INT
7. Save and Redeem the Pawn Info with the hash value of the previous Pawn INT
